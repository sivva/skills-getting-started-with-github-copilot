Step 1: Add a new route
Open the main.py file, and use the inline chat with the command Ctrl+i (on Windows) or Command+i (on Mac). This command asks GitHub Copilot to help you create a new API that shows you the cities of a country.
 
Note
Try your new route and refine your prompt until the result is as desired.
 
Step 2: Create a test
Now that you created a new route, create a test with Copilot Chat for this route that uses Spain as the country. Remember to select your code, and ask Copilot Chat to help you with this specific API that we just created. You can use the inline-chat or the dedicated chat pane with the following prompt:
textCopy
/tests help me to create a new test for this route that uses Spain as the country. Once Copilot helps you create your test, try it. If this isn't functioning as expected, feel free to share those details with Copilot in the chat. For example:
textCopy
 
This test is not quite right, it is not including cities that doesn't exist. Only Seville is part of the API.
 
Step 3: Use an agent to write the documentation
Finally, use the @workspace agent to write project documentation and details on how to run the project itself. Open the README.md file and use the following prompt in GitHub Copilot Chat:
textCopy
@workspace I want to document how to run this project so that other developers can get started quickly by reading the README.md file. You should get a response that helps you update the README.md file with the necessary information to run the project.
Congratulations on completing this exercise. You used GitHub Copilot to generate a new API route, and then write a test to verify its correctness. Finally, you added documentation using an agent that will help developers understand how to run this project.
